## 2026-10-02 — MVP

**Goal**: a DX12 MMD Windows client. This session builds the MVP: an asset engine, a player engine, and the basic screen flow on a simple raster renderer, keeping extension points for RTX, DLSS/FSR/XeSS, and advanced shaders.

### Done
- Project skeleton: CMake + Ninja (`build.cmd`), vendored dependencies (imgui 1.92, stb, miniaudio 0.11.25, DirectX-Headers, nlohmann json).
- Assets: copied from a private asset collection into `library/` (git-ignored, about 1.4 GB, 971 files).
- Asset engine: PMX 2.0/2.1 and VMD parsers, plus a content-based library classifier.
  - Classification: characters, stages (a folder of PMX files forms one stage), songs (dance + camera + facial VMDs + audio), accessories excluded.
  - Result: 30 characters, 8 stages, 14 songs, scanned in 0.2 s.
- Player engine: bone hierarchy, append bones, CCD IK (knee plane solver, Euler limits), vertex/bone/group morphs, VMD Bezier, and the MMD camera (including the distance=0 style). Audio is the master clock for sync.
- Renderer: `Dx12Context`, plus an `IRenderPass` chain (Scene → Resolve → Present).
  - Features: GPU skinning, MMD toon shading, inverted-hull outlines, MSAA HDR target, letterboxed present, GPU timestamps, PNG capture.
  - Extension points: the `IUpscaler` seam, and device capability detection (RT tier 1.2, mesh shaders, VRS).
- App: a Korean ImGui UI with three flows: select → play, and benchmark lobby → run → result.
  - Settings persist in `mmdx12.ini`.
  - CLI automation: `--autoplay`, `--frames`, `--capture`, `--screen`, `--free-camera`, `--benchmark`.
- Benchmark: fixed workload (1/60 s of motion per rendered frame, muted, vsync off, MSAA 4x, fixed resolution), using the web MikuMark score formula.
  - Official preset: DIVA Miku / theater / worldismine.
  - Result on an RTX 3060 Laptop: FHD 86,562, 4K 74,904 (1,200-frame short runs).
- Server: added `dx12-raster-fhd` and `dx12-raster-4k` to the `CATEGORIES` whitelist on the leaderboard server.
  - Backup: `server/<server script>.pre-dx12.bak`. Not committed in that repo.
- Way of working: Claude designed the headers and contracts and wrote the anim module. opencode (GLM) implemented the asset, render, and app modules in parallel, and Claude reviewed and fixed them.

### Pitfalls found
- On Windows, extracting the server's lowercase symlink aliases deletes their case-variant targets. Copy regular files only.
- FXC ignores `pack_matrix` for StructuredBuffer elements, so bone matrices arrive transposed. Fix: a struct with a `row_major` member.
- The shader copy used to be a POST_BUILD step, so a shader-only change didn't reach `bin/`. It is now the `copy_shaders` target.
- Some PMX files have the magic `PMX\xA0`. Only the first three bytes are checked now.
- Worker bugs (fixed): texture upload copy direction reversed, per-frame buffers created in the DEFAULT heap, wrong pointer passed to the PNG writer, song preset searched among characters.

### Not verified / not done
- Leaderboard **submission** was never executed (to avoid polluting the public board). Fetching works.
- No physics (Bullet): hair and skirts are rigid. Missing: material morphs, SDEF, PMD, VMD lights, shadows.
- DX12 scores dwarf the web tier thresholds (SSS = 18,000). The tier table needs revisiting when RT/post-FX arrive.
- Variant models (PS models' ITTW46 versions, furina 荒, snow_miku/miku.pmx) appear as separate entries.

### Next
- Test leaderboard submission once (with the user's consent).
- Physics (Bullet), then shadow map, HDR, and post FX as passes; then Agility SDK + DXC, DXR, and upscalers.
- A library index cache, and a thumbnail/preview on the select screen.
