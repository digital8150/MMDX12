## 2026-10-02 — MVP

**Goal**: a DX12 MMD Windows client. This session builds the MVP: an asset engine, a player engine, and the basic screen flow on a simple raster renderer, keeping extension points for RTX, DLSS/FSR/XeSS, and advanced shaders.

### Done
- Project skeleton: CMake + Ninja (`build.cmd`), vendored dependencies (imgui 1.92, stb, miniaudio 0.11.25, DirectX-Headers, nlohmann json).
- Assets: copied from a private asset collection into `library/` (git-ignored, about 1.4 GB, 971 files).
- Asset engine: PMX 2.0/2.1 and VMD parsers, plus a content-based library classifier.
  - Classification: characters, stages (a folder of PMX files forms one stage), songs (dance + camera + facial VMDs + audio), accessories excluded.
  - Result: 30 characters, 8 stages, 14 songs, scanned in 0.2 s.
- Player engine: bone hierarchy, append bones, CCD IK (knee plane solver, Euler limits), vertex/bone/group morphs, VMD Bezier, and the MMD camera (including the distance=0 style). Audio is the master clock for sync.
- Renderer: `Dx12Context`, plus an `IRenderPass` chain (Scene → Resolve → Present).
  - Features: GPU skinning, MMD toon shading, inverted-hull outlines, MSAA HDR target, letterboxed present, GPU timestamps, PNG capture.
  - Extension points: the `IUpscaler` seam, and device capability detection (RT tier 1.2, mesh shaders, VRS).
- App: a Korean ImGui UI with three flows: select → play, and benchmark lobby → run → result.
  - Settings persist in `mmdx12.ini`.
  - CLI automation: `--autoplay`, `--frames`, `--capture`, `--screen`, `--free-camera`, `--benchmark`.
- Benchmark: fixed workload (1/60 s of motion per rendered frame, muted, vsync off, MSAA 4x, fixed resolution), using the web MikuMark score formula.
  - Official preset: DIVA Miku / theater / worldismine.
  - Result on an RTX 3060 Laptop: FHD 86,562, 4K 74,904 (1,200-frame short runs).
- Server: added `dx12-raster-fhd` and `dx12-raster-4k` to the `CATEGORIES` whitelist on the leaderboard server.
  - Backup: `server/<server script>.pre-dx12.bak`. Not committed in that repo.
- Way of working: Claude designed the headers and contracts and wrote the anim module. opencode (GLM) implemented the asset, render, and app modules in parallel, and Claude reviewed and fixed them.

### Pitfalls found
- On Windows, extracting the server's lowercase symlink aliases deletes their case-variant targets. Copy regular files only.
- FXC ignores `pack_matrix` for StructuredBuffer elements, so bone matrices arrive transposed. Fix: a struct with a `row_major` member.
- The shader copy used to be a POST_BUILD step, so a shader-only change didn't reach `bin/`. It is now the `copy_shaders` target.
- Some PMX files have the magic `PMX\xA0`. Only the first three bytes are checked now.
- Worker bugs (fixed): texture upload copy direction reversed, per-frame buffers created in the DEFAULT heap, wrong pointer passed to the PNG writer, song preset searched among characters.

### Not verified / not done
- Leaderboard **submission** was never executed (to avoid polluting the public board). Fetching works.
- No physics (Bullet): hair and skirts are rigid. Missing: material morphs, SDEF, PMD, VMD lights, shadows.
- DX12 scores dwarf the web tier thresholds (SSS = 18,000). The tier table needs revisiting when RT/post-FX arrive.
- Variant models (PS models' ITTW46 versions, furina 荒, snow_miku/miku.pmx) appear as separate entries.

### Next
- Test leaderboard submission once (with the user's consent).
- Physics (Bullet), then shadow map, HDR, and post FX as passes; then Agility SDK + DXC, DXR, and upscalers.
- A library index cache, and a thumbnail/preview on the select screen.

## 2026-10-02 — DXR ray tracing, path tracing, DLSS/FSR/XeSS, RT/PT benchmarks

**Goal**: add DXR ray tracing, path tracing, and DLSS/XeSS/FSR, plus new benchmark categories (RT 4K/FHD, PT 4K/FHD).

This commit also contains earlier uncommitted work that never got a progress entry: Bullet physics, the shadow → SSAO → SSR → composite → TAA → bloom → post pass chain, the UiKit redesign (DESIGN.md/PRODUCT.md, Pretendard + Phosphor), lighting presets, and the thumbnail cache.

### Done
- Render paths (`RenderSettings::renderPath`; falls back to raster without DXR 1.1 / SM 6.5 / dxcompiler.dll):
  - RayTraced: raster G-buffer plus inline-RayQuery sun shadows in the scene PS (mmd.hlsl `RT_SHADOWS`), RTAO, and RT reflections.
  - PathTraced: compute path tracer (`pathtrace.hlsl`: sun/punctual NEE, stochastic alpha, analytic studio floor, part of MMD ambient emitted), followed by the denoiser (`pt_denoise.hlsl`: temporal → 3× à-trous → albedo remodulate). It writes the normal G-buffer, so composite/TAA/upscalers/post are unchanged. No outlines.
- `RtScene` (RayTracing.cpp): a compute shader (`skin.hlsl`) skins every model into world-space `RtVertex` buffers, including the previous pose for motion vectors. One BLAS per model with one geometry per drawable material (characters rebuilt every frame, stages once). The TLAS and the `RtGeometry` table are rebuilt per frame. Shaders read geometry bindlessly through unbounded tables over the SRV heap.
- `CompileShaderDxc` (Windows SDK dxcompiler, `-HV 2018`) and `ComputePipeline` (a shared RT root layout).
- Upscalers behind `IUpscaler`:
  - DLSS (NGX 310.9.1), FSR (FidelityFX API 2.3.0 via its loader DLL), XeSS 3.0.2 (delay-loaded).
  - Render and output resolution are now split: the upscale pass runs after TAA, and bloom/post/backdrop/present work at output size.
  - Jitter uses the FSR pixel convention; the motion-vector scale is −renderSize.
- App:
  - Render mode, upscaler, and quality on the select screen; PT samples and bounces in the advanced settings; all persisted in mmdx12.ini.
  - CLI flags `--render`, `--upscaler`, `--upscale-quality`.
  - Benchmark lobby: a render-mode selector plus 4 new categories (`dx12-rt-fhd/4k`, `dx12-pt-fhd/4k`). RT keeps MSAA 4x; PT uses 1 spp and 3 bounces; neither uses an upscaler.
- Server: added the 4 categories to the leaderboard server's `CATEGORIES` whitelist.
- SDKs vendored under `external/{dlss,xess,ffx}` (headers + import libs). The runtime DLLs are git-ignored and fetched with `tools/fetch_sdks.ps1`.
- Results on an RTX 3060 Laptop (600-frame runs, not submitted):

  | Category | Score |
  |---|---|
  | raster FHD | 23,391 |
  | RT FHD | 8,300 |
  | RT 4K | 5,282 |
  | PT FHD | 8,607 |
  | PT 4K | 4,411 |

- Way of working: Claude wrote the contracts (headers, `rt_common.hlsli`, CMake, SDK vendoring). Five opencode (GLM) workers built the parts in parallel, each in its own build dir; Claude reviewed and fixed the results.

### Pitfalls found
- HLSL 2021 (the DXC default) rejects the vector ternaries in common.hlsli, which FXC also compiles, so DXC runs with `-HV 2018`.
- Including `<d3d12.h>` before d3dx12 picks up the Windows SDK header and breaks d3dx12 (missing `TIGHT_ALIGNMENT`). Use `<directx/d3d12.h>`.
- `ffx_upscale.h` includes `../../api/include/...`, so the FidelityFX headers keep the SDK's `api/` and `upscalers/` layout.
- Worker bugs fixed: a buffer helper ignored its resource flags (UAV/AS buffers → E_INVALIDARG, then device removed); the index-buffer SRV was structured without a stride (it must be raw).
- A single jittered reflection ray is speckled without temporal accumulation. RT reflections now trace one sharp ray and approximate gloss with texture LOD and a distance fade.

### Not verified / not done
- Upscaler jitter/MV signs were checked only on paused frames, where all three upscalers converge sharp. No motion or ghosting check yet.
- At 1280x720 the benchmark lobby's start button is clipped (it fits at the default 1600x900).
- The tier table is still the web one: raster scores land in SSS.
- PT has no outlines. Lighting presets were tuned for raster; PT brightness relies on the ambient-emission heuristic.

### Next
- A temporal pass for RT effects (glossy reflections, soft RT shadows without noise) and reuse of PT history across slow camera moves.
- Retune benchmark tiers per category; test one leaderboard submission (with consent).
- A scrollable benchmark lobby for small windows.

## 2026-10-02 — Post FX: depth of field, volumetric light, colour LUTs, FFT convolution bloom

**Goal**: stronger graphics/post: 1) DoF 2) volumetrics 3) LUT 4) convolution bloom.

This commit also contains earlier uncommitted RT work that never got a progress entry: two BLASes per model
(single-/double-sided materials, `TRIANGLE_CULL_DISABLE` on the double-sided instance) so RT rays cull back faces
like the raster pass, instance masks (stage 0x01, character 0x02), and the path tracer shading character
materials with the raster toon sun (`ToonSun` in pathtrace.hlsl) instead of Lambert NEE.

### Done
- Pass order is now Composite → **Volumetric** → TAA → Upscale → **DoF** → Bloom (**mip chain or FFT**) → Post (**LUT**).
  Pass code split: `PassCommon.h` (shared helpers), `PassBloom.cpp`, `PassDof.cpp`, `PassVolumetric.cpp`.
- DoF (`dof.hlsl`, output res): signed CoC `aperture * (z - F) / z * maxRadius`, half-res Gustafsson golden-angle
  gather (~64 taps, near field bleeds over the background), tent filter, full-res blend. Focus = view z of the
  character's head bone (`FrameView::focusDistance`), otherwise autofocus on the screen centre.
- Volumetric (`volumetric.hlsl` compute + `volumetric_apply.hlsl`): half render res, 32-step jittered march through
  height fog; sun via the cascaded shadow map (ShadowPass now renders it on RT/PT too while volumetrics are on),
  spot lights as cones (omni fills at 15% to avoid a uniform veil); depth-aware blur and additive upsample into lit.
- Colour LUTs (`ColorLut.h/.cpp`): 32³ RGBA8 strip, six built-in looks (시네마틱, 따뜻한 필름, 차가운 밤, 애니 비비드,
  빈티지, 흑백) + `.cube` files from `<exe>/luts` and `<library>/luts` (trilinear resample, DOMAIN_MIN/MAX).
  `Renderer::SetColorLut` uploads; PostPass applies it after the sRGB encode with an intensity.
- FFT convolution bloom (`bloom_fft.hlsl`): 512² grid, R+iG / B+i0 packing, radix-2 Stockham FFT in groupshared
  (rows → columns × kernel spectrum → inverse columns → inverse rows), procedural kernel (core + halo + 3 spike lines
  = 6-ray starburst) normalised by K(0,0), cached spectrum. Output written into the bloom mip 0, so PostPass is unchanged.
- App: settings + ini (`dof`, `dofAperture`, `volumetric`, `volumetricDensity`, `bloomConvolution`, `colorLut`,
  `lutIntensity`), 세부 설정 → 효과 / 컬러 LUT UI (independent of the quality presets), CLI `--dof`, `--volumetric`,
  `--bloom-conv`, `--lut <name|none>` (restored on exit). The benchmark forces all four off.
- Way of working: Claude wrote the contracts (headers, stubs, settings/CLI plumbing); five opencode (GLM) workers
  implemented DoF, volumetric, FFT bloom, LUT and UI in parallel; Claude reviewed, fixed and tuned.

### Pitfalls found
- `line` is a reserved word in HLSL: DXC failed on `bloom_fft.hlsl`, and the bloom silently fell back to the mip chain.
  The worker reported it as working. Grep `mmdx12.log` for `[E]`/`[W]` (not "ERROR") after every capture.
- Worker bugs fixed: the kernel-generation dispatch had an empty UAV table (kernel never written → 0/0); the FFT grid
  was read as an SRV while still in UAV state; the `.cube` loader kept `PathToUtf8(...).c_str()` of a temporary.
- Validating the FFT: replace `CSInput` with a single bright texel at the grid centre (bin shader copy) — the output
  must show the kernel centred on screen.
- First volumetric constants washed the image out (strong height falloff left the overhead spot cones empty while the
  omni fill lit the whole volume). Now sigma0 0.005, falloff 0.02, spot boost 3.

### Not verified / not done
- No visible sun shafts in the test stages (nothing occludes the sun); only checked as an even atmospheric haze.
- Starburst spikes are subtle on these scenes (no point-like HDR highlights). Kernel parameters are constants in
  `PassBloom.cpp`, not user settings.
- The new UI section was not captured (the advanced panel is collapsed by default); only built and run.
- No performance measurement of the new passes.
- XeSS shows dotted stair-stepping on hair silhouettes, also with every new effect off (pre-existing).

### Next
- Sun-shaft test scene (or a stage with windows), temporal reuse for the volumetric march.
- Expose DoF focus mode (head / centre / manual) and the bloom kernel shape; per-preset LUT defaults.
- Investigate the XeSS hair artefact (reactive/transparency mask).
